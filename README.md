```groovy
maven(url ="https://maven.pkg.github.com/sidcasmm/gcs-resumable-wrapper") {  
  credentials {  
	  username = "YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME"  
	  password = "YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN"  
  }  
}
```
Then add the dependency in your app-level `build.gradle.kts`:
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation("com.flutteroid.gcsresummableuploadwrapper:1.0.0")
}
```
## **üöÄ Usage**
```kotlin
private lateinit var uploadManager: UploadManager

uploadManager = UploadManager.Builder(context = this)
    .setFile(file) // File to upload
    .setAccessToken("GCS_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN") // OAuth 2.0 token with storage write scope
    .setBucketName("your-gcs-bucket-id")
    .setCallback(object : UploadStateCallback {
        override fun onProgress(progress: Long) {
            Log.d("Upload", "Progress Update $progress")
        }

        override fun onSuccess() {
            Log.d("Upload", "Upload completed successfully")
        }

        override fun onFailure(error: String) {
            Log.e("Upload", "Upload failed: $error")
        }
    })
    .enableLogging(true) // Optional
    .build()

uploadManager.startUpload()
```
## **‚è∏Ô∏è Pausing, Resuming, and Aborting**
You can control the upload process with the following methods:
```kotlin

uploadManager.resumeUpload()  // Resumes the upload
uploadManager.abortUpload()   // Aborts and cancels the upload session
```
